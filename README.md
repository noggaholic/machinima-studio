Machinima Studio is a tool that let’s you create **in-game cinematics for GW2**. It also can be used for exploring the game without limits.

Machinima Studio is still in *closed-beta*, bugs may occur, if you think that something doesn’t work correctly please create a new issue and tell me exactly steps to reproduce it.

**You should know:**
Machinima Studio is a free tool that I have created in my spare time, is free to use and I don’t accept payments for it.
If you **really want to contribute** to the development of Machinima Studio, you can do the following things:

 - Participate as a developer/reverse engineer (contact me if this is the case).
 - Donate to UNHCR http://www.unhcr.org/ ($15 could provide a plastic tarpaulin to waterproof one family’s emergency shelter.) If you ever donate to this NGO then contact me and your name will appear in the credits section of the tool.
 - Native english speakers are needed to improve all the texts as I'm from Spain.
